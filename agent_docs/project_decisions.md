# Project Decisions

Append-only. Once written, entries are not revised. Superseding
decisions are new dated entries that reference the old one.

## 2026-04-17 — Initialized project_docs framework
- Re-bootstrapped (nuke path): backed up prior `agent_docs/` as
  `agent_docs.pre-init-backup/` and prior `CLAUDE.md` as
  `CLAUDE.md.pre-init-backup` before overwriting. Framework is now
  `CLAUDE.md` + `agent_docs/` split across state / backlog /
  decisions / arch.

## 2026-04-17 — Historical stable decisions (migrated from prior project_state.md)

These decisions were accumulated in the prior single-file
`project_state.md` under "Stable decisions (don't revisit)" and
are transcribed here verbatim as a single dated block. Future
decisions should be added as their own dated entries below.

### Profiles
- Only two profiles: **Flight Sim** and **General Assistant** — no custom/third profiles.
- Profile is switchable after first launch (not a one-time setup choice).
- Profile stored as `ActiveProfile` (`UserProfile` enum) on `PortableConfig` — no separate file.
- First-run profile dialog is **required** — user must choose before the app proceeds; no default assumed.
  - **Note:** F4 in the backlog proposes moving the FTUE entirely to PrepApp so Runner silently reads `ActiveProfile` from config. When F4 ships, add a new dated entry that supersedes this bullet.
- `BindingsImportCard` and `PttCard` are the two XAML elements gated by profile — do not add a third without updating `RefreshProfileVisibility()`.
- Mid-session profile changes save to config but don't re-init services — restart required for voice features; this is by design.
- Pill toggle does a **direct apply** (no dialog re-open) — `ProfilePill_Checked` handler applies profile, saves config, calls `NotifyRestartRequired()` directly.

### UI / theme
- UI/UX must follow the existing neumorphic dark theme and shared controls (Colors.xaml, Controls.xaml, etc.).
- DataGrid, TabControl/TabItem, GroupBox, CheckBox all styled via implicit styles in `Controls.xaml` — do not add per-control inline styling for these in WPF hosts.
- Drive warning (`SelectedDriveWarning`) lives in its own collapsible strip (Row 2 of root grid), not in the log header — keep it there for safety visibility.
- Model tag input overlays the tab strip via `Panel.ZIndex=2` + `BgBaseBrush` background — intentional, not a z-order bug.
- `ThemedMessageDialog` is PrepApp's general-purpose dialog primitive. All new PrepApp dialogs use it (or a custom Window with the same theme resources). `App.xaml.cs` crash handlers are the explicit exception — stay as raw `MessageBox` with zero dependency on the app resource graph.

### Build / tooling
- .NET SDK/TFM bumped to 10.0 — x64 .NET 8 runtime not present on dev machine; shared lib stays `net8.0`, tests target `net10.0`, WPF apps stay `net8.0-windows` (runtime is installed x86 only for 8.0).
- Files compiled by the tests project via `<Compile Include>` must carry their own explicit `using` directives — don't rely on the owning project's `GlobalUsings.cs`. The test project's `GlobalUsings.cs` is the correct fix location (not suppressions in source files). Established PR #126.

### Drive detection (WMI)
- **USB SSD drive detection primary path:** `ROOT\Microsoft\Windows\Storage` — `MSFT_PhysicalDisk WHERE BusType = 7` (USB) → `MSFT_Disk` join via `UniqueId` → `MSFT_Partition.DriveLetter`. Fallback: legacy `Win32_DiskDrive WHERE InterfaceType='USB'` ASSOCIATORS chain (kept for compatibility but misses UAS adapters that report SCSI). Both paths log failures via `Trace.WriteLine` instead of silently swallowing. Established F1 fix (PR #129, commit `3b20db8`). Internal drives still require the ShowFixedDrives toggle. Fail-open is acceptable here (drive enumeration, not a security gate).
- **`MSFT_PhysicalDisk` → `MSFT_Disk` join via `UniqueId` is required** before querying `MSFT_Partition.DiskNumber` — `DeviceID` on `MSFT_PhysicalDisk` is not the same value as the OS disk number. Established by Codex catch + `3b20db8`.
- **WMI disposal pattern:** always `using var collection = searcher.Get()` then `using (obj) { ... }` for each loop variable — `ManagementObjectCollection` and `ManagementObject` hold COM handles and must be explicitly disposed. Established PR #122.

### Workflow
- **TODO backlog workflow:** "tackle section X" → Claude outputs a well-formed implementation prompt + states the recommended model from the section's `**Model:**` line in `project_backlog.md`. Multi-stage sections target Stage 1 by default unless overridden. README update follows each completed section, not each stage.

## 2026-04-17 — Headless CLI is a thin HTTP client, not an in-process host

`runner-cli/` is a standalone `net8.0` project that speaks to a running
Runner over its existing LAN HTTP API (`RunnerLocalApiService`). It is
not an in-process console host for Runner, not a WPF/console-mode toggle
on the Runner project, and does not share Runner's DI/boot path. Keeps
Runner's stack unchanged, keeps the CLI dependency-light, and makes the
SSH/Tailscale use case work without touching the WPF host. Established
PR #130 (`bb59a6c`).

## 2026-04-17 — CLI config precedence: flag > env var > default

For `runner-cli/`, configuration follows the industry-standard
precedence `--flag` > env var > hardcoded default (matches kubectl,
docker, psql, ollama patterns). Default URL is `http://127.0.0.1:41555`
— mirrors `PortableConfig.NetworkPort`. API key has no default; a null
key is acceptable only when the host does not require one. API keys are
read from `--api-key` or `$FREEAI_API_KEY` and never logged, echoed, or
persisted. Established PR #130 (`bb59a6c`).

## 2026-04-18 — v1.2.x: ship each fix as its own PR + release, not bundled

Triage originally grouped X1+X2+X3 as "the v1.2.2 bundle". Stephen
revised 2026-04-18: each bug-fix section gets its own PR and its own
patch release (v1.2.2 = X2 only; X3 will be v1.2.3; X1 will be v1.2.4).
Rationale: narrower PRs are easier to revisit as context for future
work — "fewer things that each one has". Applies to the v1.2.x patch
stream; bundled PRs remain fine for multi-stage features (F3/F4/B2
etc.).
